### Using Imgui and Glad

## Overview
- This is just going over why we're using ImGui and Glad together
- For this GameEngine we will use imgui which is an immediate mode for building GUI's
** future ref ** - once we get more comfortable with game engines architectures, then \
                   possibly build our own dependent gui interfaces.
- Imgui simply just lets us handle widgets, and any sort of UI stuff.
